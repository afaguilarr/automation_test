Feature: Instagram Content
  As a portfolio visitor,
  I want the Instagram page elements to be correctly shown,
  So that I can see the content I'm interested in.

  Scenario: The Instagram page content is correctly shown
    When a visitor requests the Instagram page
    Then the Instagram page is shown
